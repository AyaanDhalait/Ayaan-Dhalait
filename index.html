<h1>About Me</h1>
</header>

<section class="page__content">

<p>
My journey into programming began when I was just <strong>5 years old</strong>. 
That’s when I was first introduced to <strong>Scratch</strong>. At that age, it wasn’t about writing code—it was about 
understanding logic, sequencing, and creativity. Scratch helped me develop the core mindset of a programmer: 
breaking ideas into steps and turning imagination into something interactive.
</p>

<p>
By the time I turned <strong>9</strong>, my interests had shifted toward real game engines and professional tools. 
I started working with <strong>Unity</strong> and learned <strong>C#</strong>, diving into game mechanics, physics systems, 
and scripting. This was my first exposure to industry-grade development, and it taught me how complex real software 
can be.
</p>

<p>
However, at around <strong>9½ years old</strong>, I experienced what I now understand as <strong>burnout</strong>. 
Unity felt overwhelming, and I stepped back from it. I continued learning <strong>C#</strong> independently for about 
a month, focusing on understanding the language itself rather than building large projects. This phase taught me an 
important lesson about pacing, balance, and sustainable learning.
</p>

<p>
From around <strong>10 to 11 years old</strong>, I explored <strong>Java</strong>. Java helped me strengthen my 
understanding of object-oriented programming, structured logic, and disciplined coding practices. 
This period played a key role in shaping how I design software systems today.
</p>

<p>
At <strong>11 years old</strong>, I entered the world of the web by learning <strong>HTML</strong>. 
What started as simple pages quickly evolved into a deeper interest in how the internet works. 
Between the ages of <strong>11 and 13</strong>, I extensively worked with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, 
building websites, experimenting with layouts, responsiveness, and client-side logic.
</p>

<p>
Also at <strong>11</strong>, I discovered <strong>Python</strong>—the language that would become my strongest tool. 
From <strong>11 to 13</strong>, I used Python for a wide range of applications, including scripting, automation, 
game development, logical problem-solving, and full projects. Python allowed me to focus on ideas rather than syntax, 
making it a perfect fit for rapid development and experimentation.
</p>

<p>
Between <strong>11 and 13</strong>, I didn’t limit myself to a single stack. I continuously explored 
<strong>new technologies, frameworks, and tools</strong>, combining backend logic with frontend development 
and experimenting with different programming paradigms. This period shaped me into a versatile, 
full-stack-oriented developer with a strong foundation in both theory and practice.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, each phase—from Scratch to Unity, from burnout to recovery, from Java to Python and web technologies—
played a critical role in shaping how I think, learn, and build today. Every step, including setbacks, contributed 
to my growth as a developer and problem solver.
