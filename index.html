      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="page__content">
      <p>Hey! I’m Ayaan, a 13-year-old developer who has been fascinated by technology since I got my first PC at age five. At first, I spent hours exploring the computer, changing wallpapers, and trying out simple programs, but my real journey started when I discovered a book about game development with JavaScript in my local library. That book opened up a whole new world for me. Since then, I have spent countless hours building games, apps, and software experiments that solve problems, teach me new skills, or simply exist because I wanted to see if I could make them work. Each project starts with a question or idea, and ends with either a tiny victory or an intense session debugging. I love the process as much as the result.</p>

<p>I began my coding journey with Code.org and Scratch at age five to six, and by seven I had already mastered Scratch and was experimenting with small games and projects. At ten, when we were introduced to HTML and CSS at school, I immediately went beyond the lessons, creating small websites and testing my ideas online. At eleven, I explored Unity and C#, which taught me the basics of 3D game development, although I eventually burned out and switched my focus. Around eleven and a half, I discovered Python, and it quickly became my strongest language. Since then, I have specialized in frontend development while also building advanced projects in Python, learning frameworks, and experimenting with full-stack applications. I spend hours each week honing my skills, building both creative and practical projects, and testing new technologies to stay ahead.</p>

<p>Over the years, many people, including teachers, friends, and some professionals, have called me a child prodigy because of the speed and depth of my learning and the projects I have built. I do not claim this for myself, but I am proud of what I have achieved and the skills I have developed. I have learned to combine creativity, logic, and technical expertise, which allows me to solve problems in ways that are both practical and unique. I constantly think of new ideas, plan them, and build them from scratch, learning something new with each project. This curiosity and persistence are what drive me every day to explore more and achieve more.</p>

<p>Being the CTO of the Student Initiative Board is one of my most rewarding experiences. In this role, I manage projects, help other students bring their ideas to life, and make sure technical challenges are handled efficiently. I plan workflows, guide teams, make architecture decisions, and take responsibility for the success of our projects. This experience has taught me leadership, project management, communication, and problem-solving skills beyond my years. I enjoy mentoring others, learning from them, and collaborating to create solutions that work for real users. The work can be hectic and chaotic at times, but the sense of accomplishment and teamwork makes it worth it.</p>

<p>Outside of my CTO responsibilities, I am deeply passionate about exploring advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and unique programming techniques. I spend hours experimenting, learning, and testing new ideas to see how things work. I also contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other young developers, sharing knowledge and learning from the work of others. Technology fascinates me not only because of what it can do today, but also because of the endless possibilities for creating something new, improving systems, and making a positive impact.</p>

<p>In addition to coding and technical work, I enjoy creative thinking and experimenting with ideas. I sketch game concepts, plan software experiments, and learn new topics simply because they seem interesting. I approach projects with curiosity and try to find ways to combine creativity with technical skill. Every experiment teaches me something, whether it succeeds or fails, and every new challenge pushes me to think differently and improve my problem-solving abilities. Learning and building have become integral parts of my daily life, and I try to make every day productive and meaningful.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting things about being young and coding is that I get to explore without fear. I can try ideas that might seem strange, make mistakes, and then fix them while learning something entirely new in the process. I enjoy creating apps that help people, games that entertain, and experiments that test the boundaries of what I know. This constant cycle of building, failing, fixing, and improving keeps me engaged, motivated, and excited about technology every single day. It also helps me understand that coding is not just about writing lines of code, but about thinking critically, solving problems creatively, and planning carefully.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing as a developer, exploring deeper areas of technology, and creating projects that have a real-world impact. I am motivated by challenges, the chance to innovate, and the opportunity to collaborate with others who are passionate about technology. My ultimate goal is to combine my technical skills with creativity to develop software that solves problems, teaches people, or inspires new ideas. For me, coding is more than a skill; it is a way to explore the world, test ideas, and express myself through meaningful projects that blend imagination and logic.</p>
