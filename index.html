    <section class="page__content">
      <p>Hey! I’m Ayaan, a 13-year-old developer who likes building apps, games, and random projects. Most of my ideas start with “what if I try this” and end with me either celebrating a tiny win or arguing with a bug for an hour.</p>

<p>I got my first PC when I was 5. At first I just changed the wallpaper every week. Then I found a book about game development with JavaScript in my local library and started coding seriously.</p>

<p>I began on Code.org and Scratch at age 5 to 6. By 7 I had mastered Scratch. At 10 we learned HTML and CSS at school and I went beyond the syllabus. At 11 I tried Unity and C# but burned out. Around 11 and a half I started Python and stuck with it. Since then I focus on frontend development while using Python at an advanced level.</p>

<p>Teachers, friends, and some professionals have called me a child prodigy because of how fast I learned and the projects I have built. I do not say it myself but it is something I hear a lot.</p>

<p>As the CTO of the Student Initiative Board I handle tech responsibilities, organize projects, and solve problems when things break. It is sometimes chaotic but always fun.</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring advanced topics like AI, quantum computing, and programming techniques that most people find surprising. I spend hours experimenting, learning new things, and testing ideas just to see what happens.</p>

<p>When I am not coding I am usually sketching game ideas, planning experiments, or teaching myself something new simply because it looks interesting. Building and learning keeps life exciting.</p>
